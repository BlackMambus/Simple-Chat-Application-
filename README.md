# Simple-Chat-Application-
Simple Chat Application using C++, I should consider the simplest possible approach that can run without external dependencies or complex setup.
Since no backend or networking was specified.
I will interpret this as a simple local chat simulator where a user can type messages and see responses or chat history interactively in the console.
